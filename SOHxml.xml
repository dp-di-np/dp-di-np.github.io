Northumbria Police response was to set up Operation Capio which assists in the dealing with the motorcycle disorder.
 
Hotspots for MCD are identified through the public and partner agency meetings such as Neighbourhood Priorities which is led by our anti-social behaviour coordinator.
 
Recently we have undertaken operations which have resulted in vehicles being seized and we are actively working with partners to undertake tenancy action where evidence of the occupiers indicate they are involved in MCD.
 
As a police force we are looking to improve the community intelligence and also undertake further operations and tenancy action regarding this area of ASB.
 
More recently operations using various tactics including the use of drones, plain clothes operations and a multi-agency approach including South Tyneside Council staff have been undertaken. In relation to the pursuit of any vehicle then the Police must be appropriately trained, and the pursuit must be risk assessed in line with their training and health and safety.
 
There are a range of tactics which can be used in relation to the motorcycle disorder, again these tactics must be undertaken by appropriately trained staff. Further tactics are being developed by Operation dragoon which is part of Northumbria Police motor patrols department. 

To note, South Tyneside Area Command have undertaken a resourcing review with a neighbourhood support team being implemented, as part of their taskings they will undertake some operational activity to deal with motorcycle disorder as well as work closely with the local authority operational MCD point of contact. </action><action-date>2025-10-13</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="Meeting"><title>Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-11-27T18:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-27T20:00:00</end-date><location><address>St Gregory's Church, Sunderland Road, South Shields</address></location></event><event type="Meeting"><title>Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-01-29T18:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-01-29T20:00:00</end-date><location><address>St Gregory's Church, Sunderland Road, South Shields</address></location></event><event type="Meeting"><title>Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-03-12T18:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-03-12T20:00:00</end-date><location><address>St Gregory's Church, Sunderland Road, South Shields</address></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Let's chat: policing in East Shields and Whitburn</title><description>An informal session to speak to local officers about policing where you live.

Through collaboration with Gateshead Council, we’ve introduced Town Ambassadors and established a dedicated Town Centre Policing Team to ensure consistency and visibility.

To address this, neighbourhood policing team has continued to ensure greater visibility and presence during peak visitor hours.
We have conducted regular visits to local bars, pubs, and clubs to ensure licence holders are operating responsibly and in accordance with their licence conditions. Enforcement action is being taken against offenders through both criminal and civil routes, including banning individuals via the Pubwatch scheme.
In partnership with others, we have also upgraded the town centre’s CCTV infrastructure, improving the quality of evidence and enhancing our ability to identify offenders.
These combined efforts have led to a continued reduction in reported incidents and a noticeable decrease in night-time economy-related crime.</action><action-date>2025-10-13</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="meeting"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>An opportunity for Hadston residents to meet with local neighbourhood officers.

As part of Operation Cloak, uniformed officers are deployed to prevent and deter sexual offending. Whilst plain clothes officers patrol and observe for any suspicious or concerning behaviour, intervening early to prevent any offending taking place. Operation Salus focuses on vehicles within the night time economy, to prevent any inappropriate use or vehicles being located in areas which could be mistaken for a taxi. All officers are briefed before deployment and are present to observe for signs of any vulnerability and offer immediate safeguarding. Our Safe Haven van is parked every Friday and Saturday night from 10pm – 4am in the Bigg Market, staffed by uniformed officers. Medical assistance is also available next to the Safe Haven. We are in the planning stages for the festive period which will be upon us soon. Our plan will include our safeguarding operations and visible presence over key dates. </action><action-date>2025-10-01</action-date></priority><priority><issue>Anti-Social Behaviour around Monument, Blackett Street and Bewick Court</issue><issue-date>2025-09-30</issue-date><action>Over the summer months we have seen increased footfall to the city centre. We did see a rise in the number of young people meeting in the city, some of which were involved in anti-social behaviour (ASB). This was particularly prevalent in the areas of the Monument, Old Eldon Square, Blackett Street, Eldon Lane. To tackle this we have been conducting both uniformed and plain clothes patrols, reviewing CCTV to identify people involved, writing letters to parents, conducting home visits, proportionately using our powers to disperse groups, issuing dispersal orders, and community protection warning notices to stop behaviour having a detrimental effect on residents and businesses in the area. We have implemented a new Graded Response process in Newcastle in conjunction with Newcastle City Council. This will ensure that those individuals who are involved in ASB are identified to their parents/guardian/carer, so they too are aware of behaviour being displayed. This is through letters home, home visits by police, joint home visits, and then to enforcement if this pro-active and early engagement does not have the impact we seek to achieve. We continue this approach into the darker nights and plans are being prepared for October half term. </action><action-date>2025-10-01</action-date></priority><priority><issue>Serious violence</issue><issue-date>2025-09-30</issue-date><action>We have a proactive team, working under Operation Spear, dedicated to reducing serious violence in the city centre. As part of their role, they focus on early identification of key individuals and target offenders. We seek to remand in custody where appropriate and look at disruption through the use of conditions, Community Protect Warning Notices and Criminal Behaviour Orders or Injunctions. Through partners in City Safe we look to make early identification of people who would benefit from diversion and intervention to remove them from situations/environments which can lead criminality. Currently, as a year on year comparison, most serious violence has been reduced by 10%. </action><action-date>2025-10-01</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="meeting"><title>Drop-in Session</title><description>Whitley Bay Westerhope and Newburn West Shields and Riverside Sunderland Central Newcastle Central (only has university student drop ins, no community events) Leam Lane, Wardley, Heworth, Felling and Bill Quay Houghton Gosforth and Great Park Benwell and Elswick Bedlington Meet your local neighbourhood team to discuss ongoing issues, get advice and information around crime prevention, and hear more about the work we're doing to keep you safe and prevent crime in your local area.</description><start-date>2025-11-04T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-04T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Newcastle Central Library, 33 New Bridge Street West, Newcastle upon Tyne</address><postcode>NE1 8AX
