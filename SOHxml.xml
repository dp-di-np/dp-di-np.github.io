Since October 2024 South Tyneside Area command have seen offenders sentenced by the courts to over 10 years' worth of custodial sentences linked to prolific offenders.  Northumbria Police and South Tyneside Council are determined to maintain that commitment to tackle crime and disorder. This has seen a reduction in retail related crimes in the whole of Jarrow and Hebburn.   Morrisons within the Viking Centre has historically been the store that has the highest number of retail crimes reported over a number of months. This issue was identified and a problem solving plan devised in February 2025, with simple but effective actions. Since the POP plan was implemented we have achieved, in one particular month, just over a 70% reduction in retail thefts. The team has built relationships with the staff at the store, engaged with security staff regarding quality of evidence and methods of reporting.</action><action-date>2025-06-26</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-11-03T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-03T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-01-05T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-01-05T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-02-16T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-02-16T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-11-03T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-03T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-01-05T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-01-05T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-02-16T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-02-16T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event></events><links><link><title>Northumbria Police</title><description/><url>http://www.northumbria.police.uk</url></link></links></team><team id="C1"><name>Gateshead Central and Quayside</name><site-url>https://soh.northumbria.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/</site-url><population>26391</population><welcome-message></welcome-message><description>As well as policing more urban areas in the town centre and its nearby suburbs, we also police more rural areas of country parkland and woodland to the west of Gateshead.

As well as more visible foot patrols, We've used a new tool to help us more efficiently obtain CCTV footage for investigations. The new technology has led to the identification of offenders and provided us with further evidence.

To address the issues, neighbourhood team shift patterns have been changed to a later finish time to give an increased presence during peak visitor hours.  We've been carrying out visits to local bars, pubs and clubs, to ensure licence holders are acting responsibly and in line with their licence.   We take enforcement action against offenders through both criminal and civil approaches, banning individuals causing issues through the Pubwatch scheme.  We have worked with partners to improve the town centre CCTV, giving us better quality evidence and improved identification rate of offenders.        The above has led to a 26% reduction in reported incidents along with  a 7% decrease in violent crime.</action><action-date>2025-06-30</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-10-09T16:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-10-09T17:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>An opportunity for Hadston residents to meet with local neighbourhood officers.

As part of Operation Cloak, uniformed officers are deployed to prevent and deter sexual offending. Whilst plain clothes officers patrol and observe for any suspicious or concerning behaviour, intervening early to prevent any offending taking place. Operation Salus focuses on vehicles within the night time economy, to prevent any inappropriate use or vehicles being located in areas which could be mistaken for a taxi.    All officers are briefed before deployment and are present to observe for signs of any vulnerability and offer immediate safeguarding.  Our Safe Haven van is parked every Friday and Saturday night from 10pm â€“ 4am in the Bigg Market, staffed by uniformed officers. Medical assistance is also available next to the Safe Haven.</action><action-date>2025-06-24</action-date></priority><priority><issue>Anti-Social Behaviour around Monument, Blackett Street and Bewick Court</issue><issue-date>2025-06-24</issue-date><action>With increased footfall to the city centre, we are tackling summer increases in ASB by conducting both uniformed and plain clothes patrols.

As part of their role, they focus on early identification of key individuals and target offenders.  We seek to remand in custody where appropriate and look at disruption through the use of conditions, Community Protect Warning Notices and Criminal Behaviour Orders or Injunctions. Through partners in City Safe we look to make early identification of people who would benefit from diversion and intervention to remove them from situations/environments which can lead criminality.  Currently, as a year on year comparison, most serious violence has been reduced by 10%.</action><action-date>2025-06-24</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="other"><title>Student drop in - Newcastle University</title><description>An opportunity for students to chat informally to the University's dedicated police officer.
