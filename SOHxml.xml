We continue to use all available powers, including dispersal notices, arrests, stop and search, prosecution for public spaces protection order, seizure of intoxicating substances, tenancy action visits and closure order notices initiated by the Council and the police.

Police and South Tyneside Council jointly make parent/guardian home visits of those involved in the disorder. 

Youth justice services are used for those young people arrested, with a view to changing behaviours and longer-term problem solving through diversionary services.

The Local authority continues to provide diversionary services and engagement at peak times.
There has been a 41% reduction in incidents recorded from Jan-Jun 2025 against the same period in 2024.</action><action-date>26/06/2025 00:00:00</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion/><suggestion_date>01/01/1900 00:00:00</suggestion_date><issue>Shop theft</issue><issue-date>26/06/2025 00:00:00</issue-date><action>We have initiated changes into shop theft protocols, implemented further resourcing to tackle this ongoing crime trend, targeted prolific offenders, obtained Community Behaviour Orders on shop theft nominals and continue to progress others. Since October 2024 South Tyneside Area command have seen offenders sentenced by the courts to over 10 years’ worth of custodial sentences linked to prolific offenders.

Northumbria Police and South Tyneside Council are determined to maintain that commitment to tackle crime and disorder. This has seen a reduction in retail related crimes in the whole of Jarrow and Hebburn. 

Morrisons within the Viking Centre has historically been the store that has the highest number of retail crimes reported over a number of months. This issue was identified and a problem solving plan devised in February 2025, with simple but effective actions. Since the POP plan was implemented we have achieved, in one particular month, just over a 70% reduction in retail thefts. The team has built relationships with the staff at the store, engaged with security staff regarding quality of evidence and methods of reporting.</action><action-date>26/06/2025 00:00:00</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-07-14T17:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-07-14T19:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Pride</title><description>Come and say hello to officers at Hebburn Pride, share your concerns, feedback and find out more about policing in South Tyneside.</description><start-date>2025-07-26T11:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-07-26T15:00:00</end-date><location><address>Fountains Park, Hebburn</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-09-15T17:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-09-15T19:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-11-03T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-03T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-01-05T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-01-05T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2026-02-16T10:00:00</start-date><end-date>2026-02-16T12:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event></events><links><link><title>Northumbria Police</title><description/><url>http://www.northumbria.police.uk</url></link></links></team><team id="C1"><name>Gateshead Central and Quayside</name><site-url>https://soh.northumbria.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/</site-url><population>26391</population><welcome-message></welcome-message><description>As well as policing more urban areas in the town centre and its nearby suburbs, we also police more rural areas of country parkland and woodland to the west of Gateshead.

Neighbourhood officers have conducted high-visibility patrols in ASB hotspot areas, particularly targeting locations affected by off-road motorcycle disorder. Working alongside partner agencies and local communities, officers have identified key individuals involved in persistent ASB and motorcycle nuisance. 

Several vehicles have been seized for road traffic offences, and tenancy warnings have been issued where appropriate. Engagement with youth services and local housing providers has supported longer-term problem-solving approaches. Op Apollo has been introduced to support this priority.

A diversion programme, Beyond the Ball, is designed to dissuade young people from involvement in anti-social bejaviour..  We have also worked with Asset Watch, who provide the town centre CCTV systems, to gather evidence of any reported issues and identify those involved.  
As a result, there has been a 63% reduction in reports made to the police relating to youth involved ASB since Jan 2025.</action><action-date>30/06/2025 00:00:00</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion/><suggestion_date>01/01/1900 00:00:00</suggestion_date><issue>Retail crime</issue><issue-date>30/06/2025 00:00:00</issue-date><action>Following a rise in shoplifting offences in Morpeth, we have made several arrests of offenders and issued community protection warnings. The introduction of Shopwatch radio handsets has enabled retailers to have direct contact with officers, allowing a quicker response.  As well as more visible foot patrols, we&amp;#39;ve used a new tool to help us more efficiently obtain CCTV footage for investigations. The new technology has led to the identification of offenders and provided us with further evidence. There has been a 48% reduction in shoplifting reports since Jan 2025 vs previous year.</action><action-date>30/06/2025 00:00:00</action-date></priority><priority><suggestion/><suggestion_date>01/01/1900 00:00:00</suggestion_date><issue>Night-time economy anti-social behaviour</issue><issue-date>30/06/2025 00:00:00</issue-date><action>Footfall within local night-time economy has increased and as a result we have seen a rise in alcohol related anti-social behaviour. 
To address the issues, neighbourhood team shift patterns have been changed to a later finish time to give an increased presence during peak visitor hours.

We&amp;#39;ve been carrying out visits to local bars, pubs and clubs, to ensure licence holders are acting responsibly and in line with their licence. 

We take enforcement action against offenders through both criminal and civil approaches, banning individuals causing issues through the Pubwatch scheme.

We have worked with partners to improve the town centre CCTV, giving us better quality evidence and improved identification rate of offenders.       
The above has led to a 26% reduction in reported incidents along with  a 7% decrease in violent crime.</action><action-date>30/06/2025 00:00:00</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-07-17T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-07-17T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-08-14T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-08-14T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-09-11T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-09-11T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-10-09T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-10-09T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-11-06T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-06T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-12-04T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-12-04T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event></events><links><link><title>Northumbria Police</title><description/><url>http://www.northumbria.police.uk</url></link></links></team><team id="F6"><name>Alnwick</name><site-url>https://soh.northumbria.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/</site-url><population>32044</population><welcome-message></welcome-message><description>Northumberland is one of the largest counties to police in England and Wales in terms of square miles.
