We continue to use all available powers, including dispersal notices, arrests, stop and search, prosecution for public spaces protection order, seizure of intoxicating substances, tenancy action visits and closure order notices initiated by the Council and the police.

Police and South Tyneside Council jointly make parent/guardian home visits of those involved in the disorder. 

Youth justice services are used for those young people arrested, with a view to changing behaviours and longer-term problem solving through diversionary services.

The Local authority continues to provide diversionary services and engagement at peak times.
There has been a 41% reduction in incidents recorded from Jan-Jun 2025 against the same period in 2024.</action><action-date>2025-06-26</action-date></priority><priority><issue>Shop theft</issue><issue-date>2025-06-26</issue-date><action>We have initiated changes into shop theft protocols, implemented further resourcing to tackle this ongoing crime trend, targeted prolific offenders, obtained Community Behaviour Orders on shop theft nominals and continue to progress others. Since October 2024 South Tyneside Area command have seen offenders sentenced by the courts to over 10 years’ worth of custodial sentences linked to prolific offenders.

Northumbria Police and South Tyneside Council are determined to maintain that commitment to tackle crime and disorder. This has seen a reduction in retail related crimes in the whole of Jarrow and Hebburn. 

Morrisons within the Viking Centre has historically been the store that has the highest number of retail crimes reported over a number of months. This issue was identified and a problem solving plan devised in February 2025, with simple but effective actions. Since the POP plan was implemented we have achieved, in one particular month, just over a 70% reduction in retail thefts. The team has built relationships with the staff at the store, engaged with security staff regarding quality of evidence and methods of reporting.</action><action-date>2025-06-26</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>The meetings are attended by elected members, Police, TWFRS and other partners to discuss local priorities and review levels of crime and incidents in the area.</description><start-date>2025-07-14T17:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-07-14T19:00:00</end-date><location><address>Hebburn Central, Glen Street</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Pride</title><description>Come and say hello to officers at Hebburn Pride, share your concerns, feedback and find out more about policing in South Tyneside.</description><start-date>2025-07-26T11:00:00</start-date><end-date>2025-07-26T15:00:00</end-date><location><address>Fountains Park, Hebburn</address><postcode>NE31 1YG</postcode><latitude>54.9745</latitude><longitude>-1.50848</longitude></location></event><event type="meeting"><title>Hebburn Community Area Forum</title><description>Operation Capio includes drone deployments, undercover patrols and dedicated days of action, working in partnership with Sunderland City Council ASB team and other key stakeholders.?

Several vehicles have been seized for road traffic offences, and tenancy warnings have been issued where appropriate. Engagement with youth services and local housing providers has supported longer-term problem-solving approaches. Op Apollo has been introduced to support this priority.

To address the issues, neighbourhood team shift patterns have been changed to a later finish time to give an increased presence during peak visitor hours.

We&amp;#39;ve been carrying out visits to local bars, pubs and clubs, to ensure licence holders are acting responsibly and in line with their licence. 

We take enforcement action against offenders through both criminal and civil approaches, banning individuals causing issues through the Pubwatch scheme.

We have worked with partners to improve the town centre CCTV, giving us better quality evidence and improved identification rate of offenders.       
The above has led to a 26% reduction in reported incidents along with  a 7% decrease in violent crime.</action><action-date>2025-06-30</action-date></priority></priorities><events><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-07-17T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-07-17T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-08-14T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-08-14T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-09-11T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-09-11T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-10-09T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-10-09T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-11-06T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-11-06T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event><event type="other"><title>Cuppa with a Coppa</title><description>Drop in and chat to your local neighbourhood policing team.</description><start-date>2025-12-04T17:30:00</start-date><end-date>2025-12-04T18:30:00</end-date><location><address>Morpeth Leisure Centre</address><postcode>NE61 1YH</postcode><latitude>55.1654</latitude><longitude>-1.68619</longitude></location></event></events><links><link><title>Northumbria Police</title><description/><url>http://www.northumbria.police.uk</url></link></links></team><team id="F6"><name>Alnwick</name><site-url>https://soh.northumbria.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/</site-url><population>32044</population><welcome-message></welcome-message><description>Northumberland is one of the largest counties to police in England and Wales in terms of square miles.

Operation Salus focuses on vehicles within the night time economy, to prevent any inappropriate use or vehicles being located in areas which could be mistaken for a taxi.  

All officers are briefed before deployment and are present to observe for signs of any vulnerability and offer immediate safeguarding.  Our Safe Haven van is parked every Friday and Saturday night from 10pm – 4am in the Bigg Market, staffed by uniformed officers.
